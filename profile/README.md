### Rayvn is an IoT-driven autonomous rescue robotics system designed for disaster and crisis response. It combines aerial drones and ground crawler bots connected via a LoRa-based mesh network, enabling offline, real-time victim detection, mapping, and 2-way communication in GPS-denied environments.

## 💫 Mission
Rayvn aims to bridge communication gaps during disasters by fusing computer vision, thermal sensing, and AI-driven coordination into a unified rescue network.

## 🧠 Core Features
- Autonomous Pathfinding (A*) — Efficient route generation for rescue navigation.
- Swarm Coordination — Multi-agent task allocation between aerial and ground units.
- Sensor Fusion — Combines camera, thermal, and gas/smoke data for robust detection.
- LoRa Mesh Network — Offline, long-range communication across nodes.
- AI-Assisted Detection — YOLOv8 + OpenCV victim recognition and hazard detection.
- Rescue Dashboard — Flask command panel for live mapping and telemetry.

## 🌍 Market Scope
Rayvn addresses a $6B Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) in global disaster robotics, with an early adoption SOM of $100M across India and Southeast Asia.

## 💰 Revenue Model
Rayvn operates on a B2G + B2B hybrid model — targeting government disaster response agencies, NGOs, and research institutions through solution-based contracts and modular hardware systems.

- Hardware Sales: Revenue from modular drone and crawler units, LoRa kits, and base station hardware.
- Software Licensing: Subscription for the AI dashboard, analytics platform, and rescue coordination tools.
- Maintenance & Training: Annual service contracts and technician training programs for field teams.
- Custom Deployments: Tailored solutions for defense research, smart city, and humanitarian applications.
- Data & Insights: Secure analytics for partner agencies on disaster pattern recognition and post-event mapping.
Revenue streams will scale alongside pilot deployments, government partnerships, and university research collaborations.
